This site features a selection of projects and experiments that I've worked on over the past few years.

*About myself* -- I am 21 years old and currently living in New York, studying at Columbia University. My interests primarily involve computers, and are focused on media technologies, communication networks, *the cloud*, and machine learning.

In an attempt to curate the information overload, I also write a weekly newsletter with my friends -- [subscribe here](http://tinyletter.com/timgrahamncanada).
